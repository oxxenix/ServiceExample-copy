# ServiceExample

This service sample demonstrates how to use .NET Web API service with:
* NATS messaging (sending and receiving messages)
* HTTP endpoint with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
* MongoDB for data storage

Service sends and receives person messages using NATS messaging system. 
It also exposes an HTTP endpoint for list operation on a sample data model, with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for easy testing and exploration of the API.
